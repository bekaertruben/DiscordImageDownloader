# Discord Image Downloader
A simple bot to download images from a discord text channel

# Requirements
Python 3.x with discord.py, requests and imgur_downloader. Can all be installed with pip: `pip install discord.py requests imgur_downloader`

# Usage
Put your bot's token in the TOKEN variable, run the code and write `dlchannel <limit>` in a channel of your choosing, where limit is the maximum amount of messages the bot will loop over. The bot will download all attatched images, images from direct links and imgur links.

# Note
This is not the prettiest code, but it serves its purpose. I don't really care enough to expand it beyond this or clean anything up.
